[![Build Status](https://drone-gh.thomaslucas.co.uk/api/badges/tjwlucas/haxe-graphql-server-php/status.svg)](https://drone-gh.thomaslucas.co.uk/tjwlucas/haxe-graphql-server-php)

> :warning: With the addition of support for the Javascript target, this package is being renamed to remove reference to PHP. Its new home will be `haxe-graphql-server` on github and `graphql-server` on haxelib.

## What is it?
`haxe-graphql-php-server` is a library for Haxe that takes traditionally defined Haxe classes and generates (using build-time macros) a GraphQL schema and set of resolvers that can be used to run a ready-to-go graphql server.
